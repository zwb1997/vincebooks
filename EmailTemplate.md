New feature request, PG related, Product limitation related 

I have raised your concern to our software engineer. Our XXX product group express great thanks for raising this incident and please allow me to share their comments: 

We take xxxxxxxx. Thus this is by design for now.
  

* After further discussion with product group, fortunately the developer team accepts this request as a reasonable feature request (to xxxxxxxxxx). 

They also confirmed that they already have this feature request in the backlog.  

Considering it may take some time to implement and test a new feature in the existing product, currently they are unable to provide a timeline for this feature. 

If needed, I would send you an email once this feature is released. 

  

As a support engineer, I really appreciate your understanding and hope you are satisfied with the result on this support ticket.  

Please don't hesitate to let me know if there is anything else I can help to coordinate with the product group, I will be very glad to help. 

  

Regarding the above status, please feel free to let me know your preference on proceeding the case. if you prefer to wait until xxxxxxsupport this, I will focus my work to follow up with them closely. As there is no need of your work, we can temporarily archive this work, so that you won't be disturbed by continuously follow up from our side. but I will do the needful to follow up with xxxxx team, and update you if it is released. You may also contact me anytime later if you need an update.

I spent some hours doing research and local tests, trying to seek any possible solution/workaround. 

Unluckily so far I failed to figure out a valid solution.  


However, I truly understand your using scenario here (it will be easier and quicker if we have such feature), and your feedback is always highly appreciated by Microsoft.  

As support ticket is raised, I will do whatever I can do to assist. I will submit an internal ticket to our xxx product team, to see if they could share more comments on this kind feature request, or any other possible alternatives. 

  

  

Since our product team is located in U.S, we may need to wait for some time to get their response.  

I will keep you posted on any progress and update once I hear from them. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to let me know

After more discussion with product group, fortunately the developer team accepts this request as a reasonable feature. They said this will become possible as part of xxxxx.

Hi Adam, thanks for the update.  I have had several correspondence with the developers.  Right now the status is the build developers are actively investigating, pending updates on what they find. They can see the issue on a few accounts as I think I may have mentioned.  I am trying to get an update as soon as I can on how long this might take.  I will keep you in the loop as I gather more data. 

  

We have solved some of the build issues on some accounts.  It seems that your problem however is a little bit different then some of the other issues.  Whilst the outcome looks the same it is a different root cause.  We are still actively working on finding out how to resolve your concern.
